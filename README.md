# GreenPods: Enhancing Energy Efficiency in Containerized Environments

## Overview
GreenPods is an open source project focused on enhancing energy efficiency within containerized environments. By integrating technologies such as Node.js, Python, and React, this project aims to develop innovative tools and methodologies for monitoring and optimizing energy consumption of containers and the servers hosting them. Our commitment to open source principles fosters collaboration, transparency, and community-driven development, ensuring the wide accessibility and adaptability of our solutions.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Employed to create efficient, scalable server-side applications and monitoring tools, leveraging asynchronous event-driven architecture.
- **Python**: Used for data collection, analysis, and the development of algorithms that accurately measure electricity usage, considering factors such as CPU, memory, storage, and network utilization.
- **React**: Implemented for developing the user interface of monitoring tools, providing an intuitive and accessible platform for visualizing energy consumption data and insights.

## Project Objectives
- To conduct comprehensive research on current practices and patterns in containerization and their impact on energy consumption.
- To develop open source monitoring tools that provide real-time insights into energy usage of containers and underlying servers.
- To analyze collected data to identify inefficiencies and areas for optimization, aiming to reduce the environmental footprint of IT infrastructures.
- To create and implement strategies for optimizing container and server configurations for improved energy efficiency.
- To share our findings and tools with the community, encouraging the adoption of energy-efficient practices in containerized environments.
